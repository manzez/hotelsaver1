python3 scripts/update-hotel-photos.py
```

### Step 2: Set Up Google Places API (Optional but Recommended)

### Step 3: Contact Hotels Directly

Create a spreadsheet from your hotel data:

```python
import json
import csv

with open('lib.hotels.json', 'r') as f:
    hotels = json.load(f)

with open('hotel-contacts.csv', 'w') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(['Hotel Name', 'City', 'Email', 'Phone', 'Website'])
    
    for hotel in hotels:
        writer.writerow([
            hotel['name'],
            hotel['city'],
            hotel.get('email', ''),
            hotel.get('phone', ''),
            hotel.get('website', '')
