### 💡 How It Works – The Magic Behind Negotiation

```
1. 🔍 Smart Search → AI-powered hotel matching based on preferences
2. 💰 Real-time Pricing → See both regular and potential negotiated prices
3. ⚡ Instant Negotiation → 5-minute countdown creates urgency for better deals
4. 🎉 Confirmed Savings → Lock in discounts up to 50% off regular rates
5. 📱 Seamless Booking → Complete reservation with preserved negotiated price
```

**The Algorithm:**
- **Premium hotels** (15 properties) maintain fixed luxury pricing
- **Negotiable hotels** (105+ properties) offer dynamic discounts based on availability, seasonality, and demand
- **Time pressure** creates win-win scenarios for both travelers and hotels

### 🎨 For New Developers – What You're Working On

If you're joining our development team, you're building more than just another booking site. You're creating:

**🏗️ A Complex Booking Engine** with real-time price calculations, multi-night stays, tax computations, and dynamic discount applications.

**📱 Mobile-First Experience** optimized for Nigerian users who primarily browse on mobile devices, with native date pickers and responsive design.

**🔐 Social Authentication** integrated with NextAuth.js supporting Google, Facebook, and Instagram - crucial for building trust in the Nigerian market.

**💾 Smart State Management** using URL-based persistence and localStorage to ensure users never lose their search progress.

## 📖 Application Overview

HotelSaver.ng is a Next.js 14 hotel booking platform that allows users to negotiate hotel prices and book local services across Nigeria. The platform focuses on four major Nigerian cities: Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and Owerri.

### 🏗️ Architecture & Key Features

#### **Core Functionality**
- **Hotel Search & Filtering**: Search hotels by city, budget range, guest count, and stay type
- **Smart Negotiate System**: Only hotels with available discounts show negotiate buttons
- **Real-time Negotiation**: Dynamic discount application with time-limited offers (5-minute expiry)
- **Search Data Persistence**: Form data preserved when navigating between pages
- **Mobile-First Design**: Native date pickers on mobile, responsive design with fixed header
- **Service Booking**: Local services like beauty, massage, catering, security
- **Food Ordering**: Nigerian cuisine with location-based filtering
- **Social Authentication**: Google, Facebook, Instagram login with NextAuth.js

#### **Technical Stack**
- Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom utility classes
- State management: URLSearchParams + React hooks (no global store)
- Date handling: react-datepicker (SSR-safe client wrapper)
- Images: Direct CDN URLs with SafeImage fallbacks
- Server: Next.js route handlers (/app/api)
- Database: Prisma (minimal PaymentIntent model)
- Testing: Playwright E2E + API scripts
- Deployment: Vercel (postinstall Prisma generate)

#### **Business Logic**
- Currency: Nigerian Naira (₦) with formatting via toLocaleString()
- VAT: 7.5% applied to multi-night stays (rounded to nearest Naira)
- Discounts: Default 15% unless overridden; time-limited 5-minute offers
- Cities: Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Owerri (hardcoded)
- Budgets: u80, 80_130, 130_200, 200p mapped to price ranges
- Mixed price fields: basePriceNGN vs price handled defensively

### 🗺️ User Journey Flow

```
1. Homepage → Search Form (City, Dates, Guests, Budget)
2. Search Results → Hotel Cards with Smart Negotiate/Book Buttons
3. Hotel Details → View Images, Amenities, Pricing Options
4. Negotiation → Real-time discount with 5-minute countdown timer (if available)
5. Booking → Contact form with preserved negotiated price
6. Confirmation → Booking ID and email confirmation
7. Authentication → Optional social login for personalized experience
```

### 📱 Key Pages & Components

#### **Primary Pages**
- `/` – Homepage with hero + search, featured hotels, services
- `/search` – Filtered results (city, budget, guests, stay type)
- `/hotel/[id]` – Hotel details with conditional negotiate button

---

## 💳 Payments & Persistence

We implemented a minimal but production-aware Paystack integration with server-side verification and a persistence layer for payment events.

### Paystack Flow
1) Payment selection on `/payment` supports:
   - Pay at Hotel (no online payment; deterministic E2E happy path)
   - Paystack (server-initiated redirect to gateway)
2) Server-side initialize route creates a PaymentIntent and returns the gateway URL
3) User pays on Paystack and is redirected to `/payment/callback`
4) Callback calls verification route; status is reconciled and user is sent to `/confirmation`
5) Webhook receives final events and updates PaymentIntent for auditability

### Implemented Endpoints
- POST `/api/paystack/initialize`
  - Validates payload (amount, email, metadata)
  - Calls Paystack initialize; stores PaymentIntent with status INITIATED and reference
  - Responds with authorization_url to redirect client
- GET `/api/paystack/verify?reference=...`
  - Verifies reference with Paystack; updates PaymentIntent status to PAID/FAILED
  - Returns normalized result for client callback handling
- POST `/api/paystack/webhook`
  - Verifies `x-paystack-signature` (HMAC SHA512 with PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY)
  - Upserts PaymentIntent (PAID/FAILED) and stores raw payload for audit

Client pages:
- `/payment` – collects context, posts to initialize, then redirects
- `/payment/callback` – reads reference/trxref, calls verify, forwards to `/confirmation`

### Prisma Model (minimal)
Model: PaymentIntent
- provider: 'paystack'
- reference: string (unique)
- amountNGN: number
- currency: 'NGN'
- email: string
- status: 'INITIATED' | 'PAID' | 'FAILED'
- propertyId: string | null
- context: JSON (booking details)
- paidAt: Date | null
- raw: JSON (last gateway payload)
- createdAt/updatedAt: Date

Migration notes:
- Prisma Client is generated on install via `postinstall`
- Apply migrations locally with `npx prisma migrate dev`
- In serverless builds (Vercel), prefer `prisma db push` or managed migrations

### Environment Variables
- PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY – required on server for initialize/verify/webhook
- DATABASE_URL – Postgres connection for Prisma
- (Optional) NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL – if needed for absolute callback URLs

See docs for step-by-step setup: docs/PAYMENT_SETUP.md and docs/PAYMENT_VALIDATION.md.

### 🔑 Environment Variables

- DATABASE_URL – Postgres connection for Prisma
- PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY – server secret for initialize/verify/webhook
- (Optional) NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL – absolute URL for callbacks

See `.env.example` for the complete list.

### 🗄️ Database (Prisma)

This project uses a minimal Prisma setup focused on payment tracking:

1) Create .env
- Copy .env.example to .env
- Set DATABASE_URL to your Postgres instance

2) Generate client and run migrations
- npm install (runs prisma generate via postinstall)
- npx prisma migrate dev  # local iterative development

3) Explore data
- npx prisma studio

Notes:
- Hotels and services are currently powered by static JSON (lib.hotels.json, lib.services.json)
- The PaymentIntent model persists payment lifecycle events
- Future work may move hotels/services into the DB for admin features

### 🧪 CI-friendly Development Workflow

```bash
# Before pushing code, run regression tests
./pre-deploy-validation.sh

# Or run individual test suites
npm run test:api          # Backend validation (fast)
npm run test:regression   # Complete test suite
npm run ci:setup          # Install all test dependencies

# Deploy with confidence
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main      # Triggers automatic deployment
```
