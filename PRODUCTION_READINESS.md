## üí° **IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS**

1. **Set up production database** - Move away from JSON files (see Appendix below)
2. **Configure email service** - For booking confirmations
3. **Implement payment gateway** - Essential for revenue
4. **Add security headers** - Critical for user safety
5. **Create legal pages** - Required for compliance

**Estimated Time to Production: 4-6 weeks**

The application has solid core functionality but needs infrastructure and business operations components to be production-ready.

## üì¶ Appendix: Production Database Setup Guide (PostgreSQL + Prisma)

Follow these steps to move from JSON-only to a production Postgres database, aligned with our current Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`).

### 1) Provision a Managed Postgres

Recommended options (pick one):
- Neon (serverless Postgres with pooling)
- Supabase (managed Postgres + auth/storage extras)
- Railway or Render (simple managed Postgres)
- AWS RDS (enterprise option)

Create a new database and copy the connection string (e.g., `postgres://user:pass@host:port/db`).

### 2) Configure Vercel Environment

In your Vercel project:
- Add Environment Variable `DATABASE_URL` = your Postgres connection string
- Add `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` (already required for payments)
- Redeploy so server functions read new env vars

Notes:
- Prisma Client generation is handled via `postinstall` during build
- For serverless, prefer providers with connection pooling enabled (Neon‚Äôs pooled connection string)

### 3) Apply Prisma Migrations to Production

From your local machine (safer and repeatable), run migrations against the production DB:

```bash
# Use the production DATABASE_URL temporarily in your shell
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@host:port/db"

# Create initial migration from current schema if needed (one-time)
# npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Apply all migrations to production
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Verify connection and inspect data
npx prisma studio
```

Alternatively (CI/CD):
- Add a deploy step that runs `prisma migrate deploy` with `DATABASE_URL` injected
- Avoid interactive commands in serverless build steps

### 4) Switch Read/Write Paths Incrementally

Short-term plan:
- Keep hotels/services read paths on JSON (existing behavior)
- Use DB for payments (PaymentIntent) immediately (already supported)

Medium-term plan:
- Introduce admin tools to manage hotels/services, populate DB from JSON
- Flip read paths to DB when data is verified

Toggle for DB-backed reads:
- Set `DATA_SOURCE=db` in environment to enable DB reads for hotels and services (falls back to JSON if DB unavailable)

### 5) Backups and Access

- Enable automated daily backups (provider setting)
- Restrict database user to least privilege
- Maintain a separate read-replica if analytics load increases

### 6) Connection Management (Serverless)

- Prefer a pooled connection string (Neon/Supabase) to avoid connection exhaustion
- If using plain Postgres, consider a PgBouncer layer
- Keep Prisma Client as a singleton per lambda to reuse connections

### 7) Health Check

Smoke-test the production DB after deploy:
- Create a test PaymentIntent via the payment flow (sandbox)
- Confirm a row appears in `PaymentIntent` with status INITIATED/PAID
- Check logs for any connection or timeout issues
